# Smart-Campus-Seating-HackElite
Team5 submission for HackElite competition of ConHacks.<br>

Introduction:
<br>
As a Conestoga student, it is always a pain in the neck to find a quiet place to study when the classroom, cafeteria and library is crowded. Therefore, our team is aiming to design an innovative solution for efficiently managing and monitoring these spaces through a smart campus seating system. This system allows users to check room occupancy, reserve seats, and earn rewards, all while ensuring fair usage.<br>
<br>
Problem Statement:
•	Limited visibility into classroom, cafeteria, and library occupancy.<br>
•	Inefficient seat reservations and allocation.<br>
•	Lack of accountability for seat reservations.<br>
•	Underutilization of campus spaces.<br>
<br>
Application Scenarios:
The Smart Campus Seating System can be applied in various scenarios:<br>
•	Classroom: Helps students and professors find available classrooms for study or lectures.<br>
•	Cafeteria: Facilitates efficient seating and mealtime planning in the cafeteria.<br>
•	Library: Enables users to locate available study spaces in the library.<br>
<br>
Benefits:
•	Enhanced space utilization.<br>
•	Improved convenience for students and faculty.<br>
•	Accountability for seat reservations.<br>
•	Incentives for responsible usage of campus spaces.<br>
<br>
Features Overview & Implementations:<br>
The Smart Campus Seating System is designed to address the challenges mentioned above. It offers the following key features:<br>

1.	User Login and Registration:<br>
•	Implement user registration functionality<br>
•	Create user roles for professors and students<br>
•	Ensure secure user authentication<br>
<br>
2.	Real-Time Schedule Display:<br>
Users can access real-time timetables to check when classrooms are occupied or available.<br>
Cafeteria and library occupancy status is also displayed.<br>
3.	Seat Reservation Mechanism:<br>
•	Develop QR code based seat reservation system<br>
•	Users can reserve seats by scanning a QR code placed on each table or classroom seat.<br>
<br>
4.	Occupancy Monitoring:<br>
The system tracks the number of people in a room or area, allowing users to gauge how busy it is by displaying room occupancy status in the user interface.<br>
<br>
5.	Reward System:<br>
•	Create a point-earning system for users.<br>
•	Implement a user interface to display earned points and available rewards.<br>
o	Points are earned with each QR code scan.<br>
o	Each scan is valid for a set time limit (e.g., 2 hours).<br>
o	Users can redeem points for various rewards.<br>
<br>
6.	Fair Usage Enforcement:<br>
•	Develop mechanism to penalize users who occupy seats without scanning the QR code<br>


Conclusion:
The Smart Campus Seating System offers a modern solution to optimize the utilization of classrooms, cafeterias, and libraries. By providing real-time information on seat availability, enforcing fair usage policies, and rewarding responsible behavior, this system contributes to a more efficient and user-friendly campus experience.
