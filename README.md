# Smart-Campus-Seating-HackElite
Team5 submission for HackElite competition of ConHacks.

Introduction:
As a Conestoga student, it is always a pain in the neck to find a quiet place to study when the classroom, cafeteria and library is crowded. Therefore, our team is aiming to design an innovative solution for efficiently managing and monitoring these spaces through a smart campus seating system. This system allows users to check room occupancy, reserve seats, and earn rewards, all while ensuring fair usage.

Problem Statement:
•	Limited visibility into classroom, cafeteria, and library occupancy.
•	Inefficient seat reservations and allocation.
•	Lack of accountability for seat reservations.
•	Underutilization of campus spaces.

Application Scenarios:
The Smart Campus Seating System can be applied in various scenarios:
•	Classroom: Helps students and professors find available classrooms for study or lectures.
•	Cafeteria: Facilitates efficient seating and mealtime planning in the cafeteria.
•	Library: Enables users to locate available study spaces in the library.

Benefits:
•	Enhanced space utilization.
•	Improved convenience for students and faculty.
•	Accountability for seat reservations.
•	Incentives for responsible usage of campus spaces.

Features Overview & Implementations:
The Smart Campus Seating System is designed to address the challenges mentioned above. It offers the following key features:

1.	User Login and Registration:
•	Implement user registration functionality
•	Create user roles for professors and students
•	Ensure secure user authentication

2.	Real-Time Schedule Display:
Users can access real-time timetables to check when classrooms are occupied or available.
Cafeteria and library occupancy status is also displayed.
3.	Seat Reservation Mechanism:
•	Develop QR code based seat reservation system
•	Users can reserve seats by scanning a QR code placed on each table or classroom seat.

4.	Occupancy Monitoring:
The system tracks the number of people in a room or area, allowing users to gauge how busy it is by displaying room occupancy status in the user interface.

5.	Reward System:
•	Create a point-earning system for users.
•	Implement a user interface to display earned points and available rewards.
o	Points are earned with each QR code scan.
o	Each scan is valid for a set time limit (e.g., 2 hours).
o	Users can redeem points for various rewards.

6.	Fair Usage Enforcement:
•	Develop mechanism to penalize users who occupy seats without scanning the QR code


Conclusion:
The Smart Campus Seating System offers a modern solution to optimize the utilization of classrooms, cafeterias, and libraries. By providing real-time information on seat availability, enforcing fair usage policies, and rewarding responsible behavior, this system contributes to a more efficient and user-friendly campus experience.
